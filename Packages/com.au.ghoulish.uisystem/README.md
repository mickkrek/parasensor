This repo is intended to be downloaded via Unity's Package Manager.
This package is to be used for creating animations for interactive UI elements.
It is built on top of Unity's UI Interactable system. It is designed to be simple to extend and make whatever animations are needed.
Also included is the Tweening library and State Machine library from 'Surge' by PixelPlacement (which is free for commercial use).

The UI animations are intended for animating things like buttons and simple animated sprites in an interactive UI canvas.

To clone and edit the contents of this repo, clone it to a blank Unity project into the /Assets/ folder.
I followed this tutorial to setup this custom package stuff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31D46795veE
