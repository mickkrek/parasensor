This repo is intended to be downloaded via Unity's Package Manager.
This package provides the basic component and input requirements for a player controlled 3D avatar.

This package right now is very basic and should be expanded upon locally in your own project.

To clone and edit the contents of this repo, clone it to a blank Unity project into the /Assets/ folder.
I followed this tutorial to setup this custom package stuff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31D46795veE
