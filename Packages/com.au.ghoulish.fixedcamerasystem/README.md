This repo is intended to be downloaded via Unity's Package Manager.
This package provides the necessary camera & area/zone systems required for 'fixed camera' games.
Also included is a toolset & systems for pre-rendered backgrounds, which is built upon the aforementioned systems.

The fixed camera system is intended for games in the 'old-school' survival horror style, however it can easily be used for many different camera angles and formats.

To clone and edit the contents of this repo, clone it to a blank Unity project into the /Assets/ folder.
I followed this tutorial to setup this custom package stuff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31D46795veE
