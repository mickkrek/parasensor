This repo is intended to be downloaded via Unity's Package Manager.
This package acts as a general base for player interactions. It can be expanded upon locally using the 'iinteractable' interface.

The interaction system is intended to be used for player-target interactions, eg. opening doors, picking up items, speaking to characters, etc.

To clone and edit the contents of this repo, clone it to a blank Unity project into the /Assets/ folder.
I followed this tutorial to setup this custom package stuff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31D46795veE
