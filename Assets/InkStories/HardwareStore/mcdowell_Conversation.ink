// when Marisol first talks to Mrs McDowell, she doesn't acknowledge her and instead is in a one-sided conversation about something mundane (running the shop or the footy or some neighbourhood gossip) with her departed husband.

MCDOWELL: The other day I went to the shops and the bananas were two dollars a kilo! Imagine that!
+   Hello?
-
MCDOWELL: ...Oh I know you love your bananas, but I don't think we can afford that with the way the shop is going.
+   I'm trying to buy this screwdriver part and... this power core too.
-
MCDOWELL: ...I don't know why you'd say that.
// feels like there should be a third neurosis for this route and the antique phone actually.... hmmmmmmm ah well

// as Marisol figures out how to talk to Mrs McDowell, she talks about more recent events and it uncovers (vaguely) what happened to her husband. 
// if Marisol shows the radio with the egg on it to Mrs McDowell, she'll mention that the lights and everything have been "flickering" ever since these eggs started appearing around the house and she then tells her husband to "clean them out because it's causing problems" or something.
// after Marisol cuts an egg off from the monster (she can show the fresh egg to her), Mrs McDowell becomes lucid for a second... before succumbing back into the past.
